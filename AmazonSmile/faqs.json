        "question": "What towns are receiving help?",
        "answer": "Puerto Rico We Care via the Amazon Wish Lists is connecting you directly with every town in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has a total of 78 towns. We divided Puerto Rico into 10 zones; Northeast, Center East, Southeast, Metro Area, Center, South, Northwest, Center West, Southwest and the islands Vieques and Culebra. Each zone, except the islands, has 8 to 9 towns. Every week each zone will rotate the towns that belong to that zone. Donations will be reaching 10 towns simultaneously every week. These donations will be distributed to families in each town."
    },
    {
        "question": "How donations are distributed?",
        "answer": "Puerto Rico We Care chose one church, no matter the denomination, in each town that will take care of receiving and distributing packages to the families that need it the most."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why can't I see the address of the church I'm sending items to?",
        "answer": "We want to provide security and protect our volunteer churches. Our donors will be able to see at checkout the address \"Puerto Rico We Care Donations\" and the town it will be going to on that specific week."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is Amazon shipping to Puerto Rico right now?",
        "answer": "Amazon is shipping to Puerto Rico, using UPS and FedEx as carriers. The delivery time frame is slower than usual and we estimate that, for now, packages arrive anywhere between 5-12 days. As infrastructure improves in Puerto Rico, delivery time will normalize with packages arriving as stated at the Amazon platform."
    },
    {
        "question": "How long does it take for items to reach the towns?",
        "answer": "As you checkout with your order, you can track when your order has shipped and when it arrived at the destination."
    },
    {
        "question": "How were points of distribution chosen?",
        "answer": "Puerto Rico We Care chose as points of distribution churches that have ministries or volunteer programs to feed the elderly, special needs children, and the homeless. Most of the chosen churches have active programs distributing food and water to families in Puerto Rico who are in need."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many churches per town will be distributing?",
        "answer": "We only chose one church per town. This way we can fairly distribute donations to all 78 towns in the island. We are confident that the churches participating in this project will give help to the people who need it the most."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I know when the town I want to send items to will be receiving donations?",
        "answer": "Puerto Rico We Care wishes to donate to towns equally and fairly. Every family in Puerto Rico need our help. We hope our donors will donate to all towns. We will broadcast weekly which towns will be accepting donations on that specific week. Be on the lookout for when we announce your town but also donate to other towns that are in need."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the time frame for this project?",
        "answer": "We have 78 towns to distribute to, 10 towns each week. Our project with Amazon Wish Lists will end on December 31st, 2017."
    },
    {
        "question": "How items in the wish list chosen?",
        "answer": "When we recruited our volunteer churches, they shared with us what each town needs. Our present list is what Puerto Rican families need the most at this moment. Our wish lists can be modified depending on what people need."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many families will benefit from these donations?",
        "answer": "Puerto Rico has a total of 3.5 million people; with your help we are trying to help 500 families per town. If we can reach more than 500 families, even better!"
    },
    {
        "question": "Who's receiving donations for hospitals?",
        "answer": "The hospital receiving donations is Centro Medico. This is the largest hospital in Puerto Rico. From Centro Medico it will be distributed to smaller hospitals around the island. The wish list for Centro Medico, at the moment, caters to the Children's Hospital but depending on the hospital needs more items will be added."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is shipping free?",
        "answer": "All of our items have free shipping if you are a Prime member. If you aren't a Prime member most items have free shipping, while others might have a requirement of items purchased in order to have free shipping. We cannot reimburse you for shipping costs since we are a non-profit organization."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I know that my items are reaching their destinations?",
        "answer": "Every week we will share with our donors pictures and videos of our churches receiving the items you donate and families receiving them. We will post how many items have been donated to each town every week."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is this method of donations more effective?",
        "answer": "As a non-profit a problem we have encountered is transportation of donations given by donors. Using Amazon Wish Lists, we can connect directly to the families in need without the hassle of trying to find transportation to Puerto Rico and how items will be distributed in the island. Amazon is a worldwide leader in logistics and has an excellent customer service. We trust that all of our donated items will reach the Puerto Rican community."
